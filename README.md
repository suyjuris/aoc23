# Advent of Code 2023

Repository containing my solutions. They are written in C++, although it is in many ways closer to C than C++ (i.e. you will not find a `std::` anywhere).

Run `./build.sh <n>` to compile, where `<n>` is the day; e.g. `./build.sh 1` compiles the first day. The executable is `aoc`, run it without any arguments (it reads from `input/<day>`, e.g. input/1). This code is Linux specific. Perhaps it compiles under other unixes as well.

The **commit messages** contain commentary on the solutions.
